# [Maze 2D](https://github.com/steelsoul/maze)
Simple rectangle shaped maze powered by [godot](https://godotengine.org/ "Free open source 2D and 3D engine").

This program was influenced by the reading of the book "Entertaining programming" (Rus: "Занимательное программирование", Максим Мозговой).
Idea to connect control of the ball with the incline of device is very very old one.
